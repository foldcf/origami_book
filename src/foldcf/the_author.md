I fold paper;
I teach, sometimes.

I used to fold origami when I was in primary and secondary school. I was not *that* serious. I mostly did the common models we taught each other — the boat, the plane, the frog etc. It was fun.

I remember one of my first 'independent discoveries': the [spaceshuttle](./figurative/the_space_shuttle.md). I made it when I was in lower primary school, I can't remember exactly when. It is made by adding three paper guns to an inverted paper boat. The one linked above is a remake I folded when I was preparing this piece.

While in high school, I started to look for instructions online, for example, "how to fold a paper crane, swan, elephant...", and then memorizing the steps in the blogs I found. I didn't have a phone then, I used my dad's. Then I stumbled upon this fish that had scales (I can't remember the designer). I was fascinated: "You mean this is possible? Scales! This is so impressive!" I discovered tessellations in the next few days, but I didn't fold one until July 2020. Here is the first tessellation I ever folded: [The First Tessellation.](./foldcf/the_first_tessellation.jpg.jpg) I think tessellations are cool.
